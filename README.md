About The Application
FoodShare Network is a real-time platform that connects restaurants with surplus 
food to nearby NGOs, shelters, and volunteers within a 10 km radius. Our goal is to 
reduce food waste and fight hunger by enabling instant redistribution of excess 
food at closing time. 
We are inspired by national initiatives like the Indian Food Sharing Alliance (IFSA) 
and India FoodBanking Network (IFBN), which aim to eliminate hunger and promote 
food safety across India. Our platform uses geolocation, smart matching, and 
community collaboration to make food sharing fast, safe, and impactful. 
Why it matters: 
 Over 224 million people in India are undernourished 
 Yet 40% of food produced is wasted annually, worth ₹92,000 crore 
 Our system helps bridge this gap—one meal, one connection at a time.
